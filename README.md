# AntaresV2
Our almost-passive flight computer

## What is Antares?

Antares is the name of our brand-new flight computer, mostly designed for modular rockets like Baine (we'll publish more things about it in the neext months)
Here we released the second version of Antares, skipping the first one because it was still a developing thing.
The improvements from the first version are a 62% mass reduction (from 103g to only 40g), a smaller size (from 16.2 cm to just 5.6cm), and a fastest processing.

## Assembly

The assembly of Antares V2 is very straight forward, only needing 
- some wires
- RP2040-Zero
- MPU6050
- 4x LR44 1.55v batteries
- 1x 3x14mm screw
- 2x 2.5x6 screws
- Hot glue
- 3D printed parts

This doesn't look like a short list, but most of the parts are really cheap!

For the assembly, first print out all the parts.

After, solder all the circuits like in the image below:
